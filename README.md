Honours thesis project implementing Unscented and Extended Kalman Filters using Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) measurements.

Produces a plot of the errors and variances generated with each filter

Just go into any file and run them. The orbit generation, filter algorithm and plotting are all done automatically in the script. LiAISON_2_satellites.py has many bugs so it probably won't give valid results but it can be fixed.
